# Reproducible Numerical Studies  

This repository-level folder collects reproducible code and data for numerical studies accompanying our research on **high-dimensional interaction modeling**. Each subfolder is self-contained and corresponds to a specific method or algorithm, providing scripts to generate synthetic experiments, reproduce figures, and validate the results reported in associated papers.  

## Current contents  
- **`sprintr/`** â€” Reproducible studies for the paper *Reluctant Interaction Modeling in Generalized Linear Models* (Lu & Yu). This folder contains simulation and plotting scripts, together with instructions for reproducing all results presented in the paper. See the dedicated [README](sprintr/README.md) for details.
